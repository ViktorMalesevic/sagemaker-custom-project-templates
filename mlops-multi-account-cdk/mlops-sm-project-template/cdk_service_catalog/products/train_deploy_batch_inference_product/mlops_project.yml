      This template includes a build and a deploy code repository (CodeCommit) associated 
      to their respective CICD pipeline (CodePipeline). The build repository and CICD pipeline 
      are used to run SageMaker pipeline(s) in dev and promote the pipeline definition to an 
      artefact bucket. The deploy repository and CICD pipeline loads the artefact SageMaker 
      pipeline definition to create a Sagemaker pipeline in preprod and production as 
      infrastructure as code (eg for batch inference). The target PREPROD/PROD accounts are 
      provided as cloudformation parameters and must be provided during project creation. 
      The PREPROD/PROD accounts need to be cdk bootstraped in advance to have the right 
      CloudFormation execution cross account roles.
